Description=fty-shm-cleanup service, one run = one cleanup
After=network.target
PartOf=bios.target

[Service]
# This service runs the cleanup routine and exits
# It is started by timer, so no need to restart automatically
# (in fact systemd throttles that as a loop too quick) nor to
# keep it fake-active as RemainAfterExit=yes.
